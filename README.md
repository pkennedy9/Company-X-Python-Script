# Company-X-python-script
Interning in the Finance department at Company X, I developed a simple python script by taking info from Company X's 
database and automating the day-to-day task that otherwise would have been done by hand. 
Significantly reduces time as the number of rows increase within the starting DataFrame. 

FYI:
DataFrames do not output correctly in "Tax Write Off.ipynb" so I included screenshots of the starting 
and finished DataFrames.
